# React Checkbox

## Instructions

Create a small React application, that has HTML form with the following fields:

- 4 checkboxes
- 1x Submit button
- 1x hidden input field

Then, on submitting the form:

1. Prevent form submission if no checkbox has been ticked and also 
  present warning message (div / span / console...) to the user.
2. If at least two checkbox have been ticked, redirect user to 'www.google.com'.

Additional Tasks:

3. Provide two solutions: one using hooks and one without hooks
4. Choose one of the solutions from previous point 
3. and upgrade it. Upgrade is very simple - make separate <Input /> component and use it instead of html inputs.
5.Provide answer to the question: in general what benefit can hidden input provide to a form?
